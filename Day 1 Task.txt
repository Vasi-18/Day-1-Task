2.  Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

	      Objects are most important in data types. Objects are different than primitive data types      (i.e string,number,boolean, etc). Primitive data types contain one value but objects can hold many values in form of key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods in context of objects.
